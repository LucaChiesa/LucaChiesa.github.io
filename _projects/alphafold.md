title: AlphaFold @ GPCRs
description: Applying AlphaFold to GPCRs
---

AlphaFold and AlphaFold-Multimer are two computational tools for the prediction of protein structure starting from sequences.
Currently alphaFOld is limited in its ability to model targets characterized by multiple conformations.
Different methods have been developed to force specific conformational state in the generated structures.
To help in this endevaor we developed [LIT-AlphaFold](https://github.com/LIT-CCM-lab/LIT-AlphaFold), a modified input preparation and struction prediction pipeline of AlphaFold.
