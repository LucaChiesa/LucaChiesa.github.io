title: Functional virtual screening trageting GPCRs
description: Developing methods for functional virtual screening targeting GPCRs
---

G-protein coupled receptor are one of the most important targets for drug discovery.
GPCRs mediate signaling in response to the binding of a ligand in the extracellular binding pocket.
Agonists stabilize an active state conformation of the receptor leading to an increase in singaling intensity, antaognists stabilize an inactive state conformation of the receptor and keep the signal intensity at basal level.
The objective of functional virtual screening is to identify ligand with a specific efficacy during the virtual screening phase.
